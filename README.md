Different data wrangling techniques used.

Various SVM kernels used.

Models built directly from the training data.

I used grid search in exercise 2 which is a method of
hyperparameter tuning that builds and evaluates a model methodically
for each combination of algorithm parameters supplied in a grid.

Grid search enables us to tweak hyperparameters by combining an
estimator with a grid search baseline.
